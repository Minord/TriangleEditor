# The Triangle Editor

We what to made a web tool for create art based on triangle i whant to be 3D and procedural. But the first prototype will be based on 2D and static tool it the we can experiment for best define other requierements for now it will work on java script.

### Objetives

* Gain Experience in JavaScript, React and WebGl
* Made the best and easy to use tool for doing triangle art
* Explore diferent mode of edit tools
* Create a smooth and clean graphical experience for the user

### Description

A web application that give us graphical tools for create and work with triangle based art solid colored triangles. the graphical style is basic the vanilla way that computer 3D graphics works then should no be hard to build a render engine to it. The most important and unique feature is the tools specialized to work width this style of art. and some declarative system for define the shape of more complex geometries similar to what CAD made use form. a system of layers.
